# DNSimple API Documentation

This is the DNSimple API documentation built with [nanoc](http://nanoc.ws/).

## Setup

Ruby 2 is required to build the site, all the dependencies are managed using Bundler, and yarn.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dnsimple/dnsimple-developer.git
cd dnsimple-developer
bundle
yarn
```

For a list of `nanoc` commands type

```shell
nanoc --help
```

To build the openapi.json file, run `rake compile` before starting nanoc.

## Development

Use `yarn live` to concurrently compile JS and CSS dependencies along with running `nanoc live`.
An autocompiler automatically compiles changed files on every HTTP request.

```shell
yarn live
