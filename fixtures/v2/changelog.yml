  title: Removed support for the Wildcard Account
  description: Removed support for the _Wildcard Account_. The wildcard account was a special character `_` you can pass in some API requests instead of a real account, and our system tried to detect the account for you. Using a wildcard is currently no longer supported, a real account ID has to be provided.
