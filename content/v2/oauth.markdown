DNSimple supports [OAuth 2.0](http://oauth.net/) for authenticating API requests. OAuth 2 is a protocol that lets external applications request authorization to private details in a user's DNSimple account without getting their password. This is preferred over Basic Authentication because tokens can be revoked by users at any time.

Developers need to register their application before getting started. A registered OAuth application is assigned a unique client ID and client secret. The client secret should not be shared.

## Web Application Flow

This is a description of the OAuth 2 flow for authorizing users from 3rd party web sites. The OAuth 2 specification is described in the [RFC6749](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1).

### Step 1 - Authorization

### Step 2 - Access Token

### Step 3 - API authentication
