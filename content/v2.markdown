## URL

All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from the `api.dnsimple.com` domain. [Sandbox accounts](/sandbox/) must use the `api.sandbox.dnsimple.com` domain.

In order to maintain compatibility in the future, all requests must specify an API version, which is appended to the URL.

    https://api.dnsimple.com/v2/


## Current Version

The current API version is `v1`. `v2` is in early development.
