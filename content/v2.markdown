# Overview

This page provides an overview of the official DNSimple API v2.

## URL

All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from the `api.dnsimple.com` domain. [Sandbox accounts](/sandbox/) must use the `api.sandbox.dnsimple.com` domain.

In order to maintain compatibility in the future, all requests must specify an API version, which is appended to the URL.

    https://api.dnsimple.com/v2/


## Current Version

The current API version is `v1`. `v2` is in early development.


## Authentication

There are three ways to authenticate through DNSimple API: the **HTTP Basic Authentication**, the **OAuth2 token** and the **Domain token**.

The HTTP Basic Authentication and the OAuth grant access to the entire account or user accounts, whereas the Domain token only grants access to the DNS records of a specific domain zone.

##### HTTP Basic Authentication

~~~
curl -u 'EMAIL:PASSWORD' https://api.dnsimple.com/v2/whoami
~~~

For users with two-factor authentication enabled, Basic Authentication requires an extra step. Check the [Authentication](/v2/authentication/) page for more information and details on how to use Oauth2 tokens via Basic Auth in place of username and password.

##### OAuth2 Token

~~~
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer OAUTH-TOKEN' https://api.dnsimple.com/v2/whoami
~~~

Note that Oauth2 tokens cam be acquired [programmatically and via OAuth dance](/v2/oauth/) or can be generated from the user/account sections in the DNSimple application.

##### DNSimple Domain Token

~~~
curl -H 'X-DNSimple-Domain-Token: DOMAIN-TOKEN' \
     https://api.dnsimple.com/v2/_/domains/example.com
~~~

The [Authentication](/v2/authentication/) page provides more information about how to use them.

## Responses

All successful responses will be returned as a JSON object with at least one key: `data`.

The `data` element will contain either a single JSON object or a list of JSON objects, depending on the endpoint.

~~~
{
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "first_name": "Jane",
    "last_name": "Smith"
  }
}
~~~

## Errors

Error responses will be returned as a JSON object with at least a `message` key. For example, failure to authenticate would result in a 401 response with a body like this:

~~~
{"message":"Authentication failed"}
~~~

## Pagination

Any API endpoint that returns a list of items requires pagination. By default we will return 30 records from any listing endpoint.

If an API endpoint returns a list of items, then it will include a `pagination` object that contains pagination information.

The `pagination` object contains the following details:

- `current_page`: The page currently returned (default: 1)
- `per_page`: The number of entries returned per page (default: 30)
- `total_entries`: The total number of entries available in the entire collection
- `total_pages`: The total number of pages available given the current `per_page` value

For example:

~~~
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "first_name": "Jane",
      "last_name": "Smith"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "first_name": "John",
      "last_name": "Smith",
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "current_page": 1,
    "per_page": 30,
    "total_entries": 2,
    "total_pages": 1
  }
}
~~~

You may include the following arguments as query parameters when you call an API endpoint that supports pagination:

- `page`: The page to return (default: 1)
- `per_page`: The number of entries to return per page (default: 30)

For example:

    https://api.dnsimple.com/v2/_/domains?per_page=100&page=2
